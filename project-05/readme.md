## What I worked on
- Built a heart logo using only SVG elements
- Practiced creating vector graphics with SVG attributes and paths

## What I learned
- How SVG graphics differ from raster images
- How `width`, `height`, and `viewBox` control SVG scaling
- How the `fill` attribute affects SVG shapes
- How the `<path>` element defines complex shapes in SVG
- Why SVG is ideal for logos due to infinite scalability

## Challenges / Considerations
- Understanding how path coordinates shape the final design
- Adjusting the viewBox to ensure proper scaling and positioning

## Code / Tools Used
- SVG element
- SVG attributes (`width`, `height`, `viewBox`, `fill`)
- `<path>` element
- freeCodeCamp editor

## Progress Made
- Successfully created a scalable heart logo using SVG only
- Improved understanding of vector graphics for web design

## Next Action (Tomorrow)
- Apply SVG graphics in a webpage
- Continue advancing HTML
